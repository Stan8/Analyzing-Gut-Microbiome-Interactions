# BLAH8-Biomedical-Relation-Annotation
Harnessing the potential of the latest information retrieval techniques relies highly on annotated corpora. In this project, we intend to introduce a corpus gathering different concepts strongly correlated with the human gut microbiome, along with the relations among them.

## Annotating the dataset
The aim of this project is to:
* Revising named entities annotations imported from PubTator.
* Annotating relations linking entities.
